# Facebook Messenger ChatBot Demo

This demo shows the manual integration with [Facebook Messenger](https://developers.facebook.com/),
[API.ai](https://console.api.ai), and [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/).

This bot allows you to have a small talk on Facebook Messenger.
If you ask about weather, the bot returns with the current condition in a certain city.

**Live Demo** — Scan the code below (the one looks sort of like a QR code) from the Messenger App on mobile, or access on [m.me/tomomiBot](https://www.messenger.com/t/tomomiBot/) from browser.

Try telling the bot, "Hello", "Who are you?", "How is the weather in Tokyo?", etc.
