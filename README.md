# Facebook Messenger ChatBot Demo

This demo shows the manual integration with [Facebook Messenger](https://developers.facebook.com/),
[API.ai](https://console.api.ai), and [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/).

This bot allows you to have a small talk on Facebook Messenger.
If you ask about weather, the bot returns with the current condition in a certain city.

**Live Demo** - I have deployed to Heroku, however, Facebook doesn't allow the bot to interact with public until the bot is approved. I just submitted as of the evening of Jan 6, so stay tuned. Once approved, you can scan the code (a sort of like a QR code), also search @TomomiBot on Messenger.

Try telling the bot, "Hello", "Who are you?", "How is the weather in Tokyo?", etc.
